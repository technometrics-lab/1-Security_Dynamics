Installation
============

You don't need to install anything if you use the **venv** (on Linux)::

  source venv/bin/activate

If you prefer to install all dependencies in your own environment (all the following commands are for Linux-Debian/Ubuntu)::

  pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure that you already have the python3-dev package installed on your laptop::

  apt install python3-dev

Install the **texthero** package seperatly (only the git version is compatible)::

  pip install git+https://github.com/jbesomi/texthero.git
